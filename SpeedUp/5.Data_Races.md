# Data Race

## Definition

_It is a common problem in multithreaded programming. Data races occur when multiple tasks or threads access a shared resource without sufficient protections, leading to undefined or unpredictable behavior._

### The problem occurs when 

a) Two or more concurrent threads access the same memory location

b) At least one thread is modifying it

### How to solve it
Pay attention whenever two or more threads access the same shared resourse
Use synchronization algorithms!

```python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
""" Two shoppers adding items to a shared notepad """

import threading

garlic_count = 0

def shopper():
    global garlic_count
    for i in range(10_000_000):
        garlic_count += 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    barron = threading.Thread(target=shopper)
    olivia = threading.Thread(target=shopper)
    barron.start()
    olivia.start()
    barron.join()
    olivia.join()
    print('We should buy', garlic_count, 'garlic.')
 ```
