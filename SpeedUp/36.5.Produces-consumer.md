# Producer-Consumer Pattern

## Definition

_The producer-consumer pattern is a design pattern that solves the problem of concurrency in a multi-threaded
environment. It is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem._

It involves producer tasks, consumer tasks and a shared buffer or queue that connects these two types of tasks.

| Producer Tasks                                   |                         Consumer Tasks                         |                         Shared Buffer                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Generate work that is added to the shared buffer | Remove work from the shared buffer and process it in some way. |Thread-safe data structure that connects producers and consumers that may be bounded |                               


1. Producer tasks - responsible for generating items or data and placing them on the shared buffer.
They produce work to be consumed. 

###### Producers may run until there are no further items to generate


2. Consumer tasks - responsible for removing items from the shared buffer and processing them. If there are no items in the shared buffer, a consumer task may wait or block until items become available.

###### Consumers may run until there are no further items to consume

3. Shared buffer - a thread-safe data structure that connects producers and consumers. 


The shared buffer may or may not be bounded, meaning it may have a limited size. If so, producer tasks may have to wait or block until space becomes available to add new items.

### Important
_Additionally, the shared buffer must be thread-safe, ensuring that items can be added and removed concurrently by multiple threads or processes without race condition or corruption of the internal data structures._


## Example

Let's take a look at a simple example of the producer-consumer pattern. We'll use a shared buffer that is a queue. The queue is implemented using a linked list.

```python
import queue
import threading
import time
import random
# A shared buffer that is a queue
shared_buffer = queue.Queue()

# Producer task
def producer():
    while True:
        # Generate a random number
        item = random.randint(0, 256)
        # Add the item to the shared buffer
        shared_buffer.put(item)
        print('Producer added item to buffer:', item)
        # Sleep for a random time
        time.sleep(random.random())

# Consumer task
def consumer():
    while True:
        # Remove an item from the shared buffer
        item = shared_buffer.get()
        # Process the item
        print('Consumer removed item from buffer:', item)
        # Sleep for a random time
        time.sleep(random.random())

# Create and start the producer and consumer threads
producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)
consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)
producer_thread.start()
consumer_thread.start()

# Wait for the producer and consumer threads to finish
producer_thread.join()
consumer_thread.join()

```
