# SOLID

_SOLID - is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable,
flexible, and maintainable._

| O   | [Open-Closed](SOLID/2.Open_Closed_Principle.md)                             |
| L   | [Liskov Substitution](SOLID/3.Liskov_substitution_principle.md)             |
| I   | [Interface Segregation](SOLID/4.Interface_Segregation_Principle.md)         |
| D   | [Dependency Inversion](SOLID/5.Dependency_Inversion_Principle.md)           |

_Each of these principles addresses a different aspect of software design and can be used together to produce
high-quality, flexible, and maintainable code._

_They help developers create software that is resilient to change and can evolve with the needs of the business or the users._

## Single Responsibility Principle

_"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."_

_According to the single responsibility principle (SRP), each class, method, and function should only serve one purpose
or be modified for that purpose._

## Open Closed Principle

_When new behavior is necessary, modules are frequently altered in practice, which is against the OCP. We want to be
adaptable while maintaining fixed behavior. confused: Let's see how these conflicts can coexist._

## Liskov substitution principle

_According to the Liskov substitution principle, a child class must be interchangeable with its parent class. The goal
of the Liskov substitution principle is to guarantee that a child class can replace a parent class without creating any
errors._

## Interface segregation principle

_“Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”_

_The idea behind interface separation is to separate the software into several independent parts in order to minimize
side
effects and the frequency of required changes._

# Dependency Inversion Principle

_High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules._

_Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces)._

_A component shouldn't have a source code dependency on specific implementations if it needs to be able to switch
between them._
