## Interface segregation principle

_“Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”_

_The idea behind interface separation is to separate the software into several independent parts in order to minimize
side
effects and the frequency of required changes._

In other words, an interface should be designed so that a client can use only the methods that are relevant to it,
without being forced to implement unnecessary methods.

_First, define a Vehicle abstract class that has two abstract methods, go() and fly():_

## Incorrect Example #1:

```python

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def go(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fly(self):
        pass
```

_Second, the Aircraft class that inherits from
the Vehicle class and implement both go() and fly() methods:_

```python
class Aircraft(Vehicle):
    def go(self):
        print("Taxiing")

    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")
```

_Third, the Car class that inherits from the Vehicle class. But a car cannot fly, we raise an exception in the fly()
method:_

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def go(self):
        print("Going")

    def fly(self):
        raise Exception('The car cannot fly')
```

### Solution #1

_To fix this, you need to split the Vehicle class into small ones and inherits from these classes from the Aircraft and
Car classes:_

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


## Solution
# split the Vehicle interface into two smaller interfaces: Movable and Flyable
class Movable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def go(self):
        pass


class Flyable(Movable):
    @abstractmethod
    def fly(self):
        pass


# inherits from the Flyable class from the Aircraft class
class Aircraft(Flyable):
    def go(self):
        print("Taxiing")

    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")


# inherit the Movable class from the Car class:
class Car(Movable):
    def go(self):
        print("Going")
```

## Incorrect Example #2:

```python
class Machine:
    def print_document(self, document):
        pass

    def fax_document(self, document):
        pass

    def scan_document(self, document):
        pass


class Printer(Machine):
    def print_document(self, document):
        print("Printing document...")


class Fax(Machine):
    def fax_document(self, document):
        print("Faxing document...")


class Scanner(Machine):
    def scan_document(self, document):
        print("Scanning document...")


class Photocopier(Machine):
    def print_document(self, document):
        print("Printing document...")

    def scan_document(self, document):
        print("Scanning document...")
```

## Explanation

_Not all the methods in the Machine class are __relevant__ to all the derived classes._

_`Printer` does
not need to implement the fax_document() or scan_document() methods, but it is forced to do so because they are defined
in the Machine class._

_This violates the ISP, because the Printer class is forced to depend on methods it does not use._

### Solution #2

_The solution is to split the Machine class into smaller interfaces:_

```python
class Printer:
    def print_document(self, document):
        pass


class Fax:
    def fax_document(self, document):
        pass


class Scanner:
    def scan_document(self, document):
        pass


class Photocopier(Printer, Scanner):
    pass
```

## Explanation

_We have four classes that define smaller interfaces, but they do not inherit any unnecessary methods._

## Incorrect Example #3

```python
class DataAccess:
    def read(self, id):
        pass

    def write(self, id, data):
        pass

    def delete(self, id):
        pass


class DatabaseDataAccess(DataAccess):
    def read(self, id):
        print(f"Reading data with id {id} from database...")

    def write(self, id, data):
        print(f"Writing data with id {id} to database...")

    def delete(self, id):
        print(f"Deleting data with id {id} from database...")


class FileDataAccess(DataAccess):
    def read(self, id):
        print(f"Reading data with id {id} from file...")

    def write(self, id, data):
        print(f"Writing data with id {id} to file...")

    def delete(self, id):
        print(f"Deleting data with id {id} from file...")
```

## Explanation

_The main problem here is that the FileDataAccess class does not need to implement `the delete()` method, but it is forced
to_

### Solution #3

```python
class Readable:
    def read(self, id):
        pass

class Writable:
    def write(self, id, data):
        pass

class Deletable:
    def delete(self, id):
        pass

class DatabaseDataAccess(Readable, Writable, Deletable):
    def read(self, id):
        print(f"Reading data with id {id} from database...")

    def write(self, id, data):
        print(f"Writing data with id {id} to database...")

    def delete(self, id):
        print(f"Deleting data with id {id} from database...")

class FileDataAccess(Readable, Writable):
    def read(self, id):
        print(f"Reading data with id {id} from file...")

    def write(self, id, data):
        print(f"Writing data with id {id} to file...")

```

## Explanation

_We have three interfaces: Readable, Writable, and Deletable._ 

_The DatabaseDataAccess class implements all three interfaces, while the FileDataAccess class implements only the_
_Readable and Writable interfaces._

_Classes then implement the appropriate interfaces, without being forced to implement any unnecessary methods._
