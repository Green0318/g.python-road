# Dependency Inversion Principle

_High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules._

_Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces)._

_A component shouldn't have a source code dependency on specific implementations if it needs to be able to switch
between them._

## Example

```python
class PaymentGateway:
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass


class PayPalGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing payment of ${amount} via PayPal...")


class StripeGateway(PaymentGateway):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing payment of ${amount} via Stripe...")


class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self, payment_gateway):
        self.payment_gateway = payment_gateway

    def checkout(self, amount):
        self.payment_gateway.process_payment(amount)


paypal_gateway = PayPalGateway()
shopping_cart = ShoppingCart(paypal_gateway)
shopping_cart.checkout(100)

stripe_gateway = StripeGateway()
shopping_cart = ShoppingCart(stripe_gateway)
shopping_cart.checkout(200)
```

### Explanation:

_The Dependency Inversion Principle is followed because the ShoppingCart class depends on the abstraction of the
PaymentGateway class, rather than on the implementation details of the PayPalGateway or StripeGateway classes._

_This allows the ShoppingCart class to work with any PaymentGateway object, as long as it conforms to the PaymentGateway
interface._
