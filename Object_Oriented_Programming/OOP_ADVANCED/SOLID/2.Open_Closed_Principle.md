## Open Closed Principle

_When new behavior is necessary, modules are frequently altered in practice, which is against the OCP. We want to be
adaptable while maintaining fixed behavior. confused: Let's see how these conflicts can coexist._

## Incrorect Example #1

This is a bad example of the OCP. The class `Soldier` has a method `attack` that takes a string as an argument.

```python
class Soldier:

    def __init_(self, weapon: str):
        self.weapon = weapon
    def attack(self) -> None:
        if self.weapon == "gun":
            print("The soldier is shooting.")
        elif self.weapon == "grenade":
            print("The a soldier throws a grenade.")
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"The soldier doesn't have a {weapon}")
```
_This example violates the OCP because we would have to alter the attack strategy if we wanted the soldier to use a different weapon.
The creation of functions for each weapon that is passed to and used by the attack method would be a better strategy._

## Solution #1

```python
class Soldier:
    def attack(self, weapon) -> None:
        weapon()


def gun():
    print("The soldier shoots.")


def grenade():
    print("The a soldier throws a grenade.")


alfa = Soldier()
alfa.attack(gun)
```

## Explanation

_The OCP is followed because the Soldier class is closed for modification, but open for extension. We can add new weapons without_


PS. Here we can use a magic method ```__call__```
