## Single Responsibility Principle

_"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change."_

_According to the single responsibility principle (SRP), each class, method, and function should only serve one purpose
or be modified for that purpose._

## Example #1

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Person(name={self.name})'


class PersonDB:
    def save(self, person):
        print(f'Save the {person} to the database')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = Person('John Doe')

    db = PersonDB()
    db.save(p)
```

### Explanation:

_The `Person` class is responsible for managing the person’s properties._

_The `PersonDB` class is responsible for storing the person in the database._

_The `PersonDB` class is not responsible for creating the person object._

_If we want to change the way the person is stored in the database, we only need to modify the `PersonDB` class, the
same is with `Person`_

## Example #2

```python
class Email:
    def __init__(self, sender, recipient, subject, message):
        self.sender = sender
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.subject = subject
        self.message = message


class EmailSender:
    def send_email(self, email):
        # Code to send email using SMTP
        print(f"Email sent from {email.sender} to {email.recipient} with subject '{email.subject}'.")


class EmailLogger:
    def log_email(self, email):
        # Code to log email to file or database
        print(f"Email logged from {email.sender} to {email.recipient} with subject '{email.subject}'.")


email = Email("jane.doe@example.com", "john.doe@example.com", "Hello", "Hi John, how are you doing?")
email_sender = EmailSender()
email_logger = EmailLogger()

email_sender.send_email(email)
email_logger.log_email(email)

```

### Explanation:

_The `Email` class is responsible for managing the email’s properties._
_The `EmailSender` class is responsible for sending the email._
_The `EmailLogger` class is responsible for logging the email._

_Each class has a single responsibility._
