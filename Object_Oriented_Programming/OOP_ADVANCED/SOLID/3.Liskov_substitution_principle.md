## Liskov substitution principle

_According to the Liskov substitution principle, a child class must be interchangeable with its parent class. The goal
of the Liskov substitution principle is to guarantee that a child class can replace a parent class without creating any
errors._

In other words, a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without causing errors or unexpected behavior.

## Example #1

```python

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass


class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height


class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side ** 2


def print_area(shape):
    print(shape.area())


rect = Rectangle(2, 3)
square = Square(2)

print_area(rect)  # prints 6
print_area(square)  # prints 4

```

### Explanation:

The Liskov substitution principle is followed because any code that expects a Shape object should be able to use a
Rectangle or Square object interchangeably, without any unexpected behavior or errors.

## Example #2

```python

class Vehicle:
    def drive(self):
        pass


class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving car...")


class Bicycle(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Riding bicycle...")


class Driver:
    def __init__(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicle = vehicle

    def drive_vehicle(self):
        self.vehicle.drive()


car = Car()
bicycle = Bicycle()

driver1 = Driver(car)
driver1.drive_vehicle()  # Driving car...

driver2 = Driver(bicycle)
driver2.drive_vehicle()  # Riding bicycle...
```

### Explanation:

The Liskov Substitution Principle is followed because both Car and Bicycle objects can be used interchangeably with the
Vehicle parameter in the Driver class, without affecting the correctness of the program. 

This is because both Car and
Bicycle classes implement the drive() method, and therefore they behave like Vehicle object.
