## Integers
An integer is a whole number with no decimal places. For example, 1 is an integer, but 1.0 isnâ€™t.
The name for the integer data type is int, which you can see with type():
```python
x = 10
print(type(x))
# <class 'int'>
```
## Float
A floating-point number, or float for short, is a number with a decimal place.
1.0 is a floating-point number, as is -2.75. 
The name of the floating-point data type is float:
```python
x = 12.5
print(type(x))
# <class 'float'>
```
### Arithmetic Operators and Expressions numbers:
#### Addition:
```python
print(1+2)          # 3
print(1.0 + 2)      # 3.0

```
#### Subtraction:
```python
print(10 - 5)       # 5 
print(12.0 - 3)     # 9.
print(10 - 15)      # -5
```
#### Multiplication:
```python
print(3 * 6)        # 18
print(3.5 * 2)      #7.0
```
#### Division:
```python
print(20 / 5)       # 4
print(7 / 2)        # 3.5
```
#### Integer Division:
```python
print(10 // 3)      # 3
print(15 // 2)      # 7
print(7.5 // 3)     # 2.0
```
#### Exponents:
```python
print(2 ** 3)       # 8
print(4 ** 3 )      # 64
print(9 ** 0.5)     # 3.0
```
#### The Modulus Operator:
```python
print(5 % 2)        # 1
print(20 % 7)       # 6
```
