# Logical operations
## if/else
Ok, now we know how to make arithmetical operations and input and output data, but code must
be able to do different tasks in relation to input. to make decisions program identifies either
a statement is true or false. Consider this example:
```python
country = input('which country are you from?')
if country == 'Ukraine':
    print('you are Ukrainian')
else:
    print('you are not Ukrainian')
```
Program asks user to write  his country and if it is true that variable `country` equals 
`'Ukraine'`then it prints:
```
you are Ukrainian
```
else:
```
you are not Ukrainian
```
pretty straight forward, isn't it.
## Relational operators
Sometimes only checking equality will not be enough, for example if you have to compare two
or more values(bigger, smaller, etc.). It is very simple and quite similar to actual math:
<br/>
(>) - greater than;
<br/>
(>=) - greater or equal to;
<br/>
(<) - less than;
<br/>
(<=) - less or equal to;
<br/>
(!=) - not equal.
<br/>
Example:
```python
age = int(input('what is your age'))
if age >= 18:
    print('you are old enough')
else:
    print('you re not old enough')
```
the program waits for user to type his age and writes this value into the `age` variable.
Then it checks if `age` is equal or greater than 18, it prints 'you are old enough',
and if the statement is false - 'you are not old enough'.
## elif
The `elif` is a shortened version of else if, it allows you to have multiple conditions in one body
, if the condition of block `if` is false then it checks next `elif` block, and so on, and so on,
until all the elif blocks finish and then `else` block executes. Example:
```python
num = 0
if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is a positive number')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is a negative number')
```
#### Output:
```
0 is zero
```
this program firstly checks if `num` is greater than 0, or if it is positive. Then, if the
statement is false it goes to `elif blocks` and checks if number equals zero, which it does,
and because it is true, program prints 'o is zero'.
## logical operators
Sometimes you will need more complex statements, for example, if you have to compare more than one
variable with different values in one statement. And here go logical operators, they are used on 
conditional statements (either True or False). They perform Logical AND, Logical OR and Logical
NOT operations.

| Operator	 | Description	                                         | Syntax   |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| and       | 	Logical AND: True if both the operands are true     | 	x and y |
| or        | 	Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true	 | 	x or y  |
| not       | 	Logical NOT: True if operand is false	              | 	not x   |
Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 10
if a > 0 and b > 0:
    print('both numbers are positive')
elif a > 0 or b > 0:
    print('one number is positive')
else:
    print('neither of numbers is positive')
```
#### Output:
```
both numbers are positive
```
This program checks if variables `a` and `b` are positive nad prints different
texts in relation to values of `a` and `b`.
#### Important:
If you have more than one logical operator in one statement then they execute
in exact order:
<br/>
firstly - `not`
<br/>
secondly - `and`
<br/>
thirdly - `or`
## Real usage examples:
### First example:
To demonstrate how all the material from this guide can be used we
can create few interesting programs. For example currency change
program:
```python
while True:
    initial_currency = input("money of what currency do you have(uah/usd/rub)")
    amount = float(input("how much money do you have?"))
    final_currency = input("what currency do you need?(uah/usd/rub)")
    if initial_currency == "rub" or final_currency == "rub":
        print("Fuck you")
    elif initial_currency == "uah" and final_currency == "usd":
        print("in dollars it is: ", amount/37, "$", sep='')
    elif initial_currency == "usd" and final_currency == "uah":
        print("in hryvnas it is: ", amount*37, "₴", sep='')
    else:
        print("sorry, we don't work with this currency")
```
We put all the code into infinite loop, so it can make more than one 
currency change operation without having to run this program every 
single time.
The program firstly asks what currency user has right 
now(`initial_currency`), how much money he has(`amount`) and what
currency he wants(`final_currency`).
<br/>

After that, if user answer that he has, or he wants rubbles, we print "
fuck you". If he says that he has dollars and wants hryvnas we
print how much it will be in hryvnas and vice versa. And, for example
, if user has or wants euro, we print that we don't work with this
currency because we didn't write `if` blocks for euro operations.
#### Output:
```
money of what currency do you have(uah/usd/rub)usd
how much money do you have?37
what currency do you need?(uah/usd/rub)uah
in hryvnas it is: 1369.0₴
money of what currency do you have(uah/usd/rub)uah
how much money do you have?1342
what currency do you need?(uah/usd/rub)usd
in dollars it is: 36.270270270270274$
money of what currency do you have(uah/usd/rub)rub
how much money do you have?34
what currency do you need?(uah/usd/rub)usd
Fuck you
money of what currency do you have(uah/usd/rub)eur
how much money do you have?23
what currency do you need?(uah/usd/rub)usd
sorry, we don't work with this currency
```
### Second example:
We can also create a program that calculates roots of 
quadratic equation:
```python
a = float(input("input first coefficient"))
b = float(input("input second coefficient"))
c = float(input("input third coefficient"))
discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c  # finding discriminant of quadratic equation
if discriminant > 0:
    x1 = (-b - discriminant ** 0.5) / (2 * a)  # **0.5 is the same as square root
    x2 = (-b + discriminant ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
    print("first root:", x1)
    print("second root:", x2)
elif discriminant == 0:
    x = -b / (2 * a)
    print("root:", x)
else:
    print("no roots")

```
Here, code speaks for itself, we ask coefficients of quadratic 
polynomial, find discriminant and depending on its value print 
roots.
#### Output:
```
input first coefficient - 4
input second coefficient - 5
input third coefficient - 1
first root: -1.0
second root: -0.25
```
### Third example:
Using conditional operators you can also prevent some errors: 
For example if you have program that takes two numbers `a` and `b`
and divides them, but what if `b` = 0, program breaks, because you
can't divide by 0:
```python
while True:
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a / b)
```
#### Output:
```
3
0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
And in order to prevent this kind of mistakes you can use `if`:
```python
while True:
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    if b == 0:
        print("can't divide by zero")
    else:
        print(a / b)
```
#### Output:
```
3
0
can't divide by zero
3
3
1.0
```
Here it checks the value of `b` and if it is 0 program prints 
that you can't divide by zero and continues like nothing happened.
