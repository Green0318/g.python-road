## Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and *unchangeable*.
Tuples are written with round brackets
```python
the_tuple = (21,90,"programming",True)
print(the_tuple)        # (21, 90, 'programming', True)
```
#### Tuple items are ordered, allow duplicate values but unchangeable:
```python
test_tuple  = (21,90,"programming",True,["apple","fruit"])
print(test_tuple[2])        # programming
print(test_tuple[-1][0])        # apple
test_tuple[2] = 18      #'tuple' object does not support item assignment
test_tuple[-1][1] = "vegetable"
print(test_tuple)       #(21, 90, 'programming', True, ['apple', 'vegetable'])
```
#### In tuple basic functions, like in list
```python
num_tuple = [15,24,78]
print(len(num_tuple))    # 3
print(max(num_tuple))    # 78
print(min(num_tuple))    # 15
print(sum(num_tuple))    # 117
print(num_tuple * 2)     # [15, 24, 78, 15, 24, 78]
```
### Tuple methods
### tuple.count() -->	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
```python
thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
x = thistuple.count(5)
print(x)        # 2   
```
### tuple.index() -->	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
```python
test_tuple = (1,3,6,8,1,2)
print(test_tuple.index(3))      # 1
```
